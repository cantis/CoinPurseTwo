# CoinPurseTwo
A refresh of my Coin Purse project trying to catch it up with what I have learned.

This is just the walking skeleton of the project.  I am going to add more to it as I go.

Intention: The Coin Purse application acts as a 'running total' with additions and removals from a player's 'coin purse' it tracks the actions that a player takes... They buy arrows, sell an old sword all of that is tracked by date and session number.

tables: player, character, account, transaction

See the docs folder for ER diagram of the above tables.
