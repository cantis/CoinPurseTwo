# CoinPurseTwo

## Description
Coinpurse is like a Pathfinder or D&D (or other) adventurers 'money pouch' and 'ledger' combined. It keeps track of how much gold you have and what you spend it on for each character. Note: Coinpurse understands decimal gold pieces and converts any coin entered into that standard *N.B. I have not coded for Electrum if thats still in use in D&D*

# Project Setup
I'll add the project setup and run info here as I create it.

## Notes & Dev Journal
My Development journal is in the docs folder and I'll update that for each session.
